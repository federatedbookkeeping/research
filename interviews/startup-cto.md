Explored various topics and potential entry points, including trying to build a pilot for a big company. Then identified a painpoint this friend had in their own small company: they have 20 suppliers, and each of them send a pdf invoice which is an annoying chore to import into their bookkeeping system. Would be great if the bookkeeping system could do an API integration with those suppliers.

LedgerLoops is nice in theory but in practice it's unlikely that a loop would be found since for individual humans money often just flows from salary to shop, and then only loop back to salary via long routes and/or big enterprise bank accounts.

If a company offers a money-related platform it's often not so useful to federate.

There is a risk that I think too much about a single small product and lose sight of the bigger vision and its potential. But supplier invoice -> consumer bookkeeping software integration is on-topic enough, I think.
